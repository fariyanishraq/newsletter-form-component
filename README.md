# Newsletter with Success Message

This project is a simple newsletter form that allows users to enter their name and email address and subscribe to a newsletter. The form has basic validation to check if the inputs are valid and not empty. Upon successful submission, the form displays a success message that thanks the user and confirms their subscription.

The project is built with React, TypeScript, Zod and TailwindCSS. React is used to create the components and handle the state and events of the form. TypeScript is used to add type safety and catch errors at compile time. Zod is used to create schemas for validating the inputs. TailwindCSS is used to style the components and add responsiveness.

The project demonstrates my skills with basic form structure, validation, and submission. It also shows how I can work with DOM manipulation to dynamically change the content of the page based on the form status.
